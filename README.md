##Before starting Task 3, I explored the fundamentals of Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) and image classification by revisiting my college notes and watching a few tutorials on YouTube. I wanted to clearly understand how images are processed and how CNNs identify visual patterns to classify them. To strengthen my foundation, I also referred to helpful explanations on GeeksforGeeks and asked ChatGPT to simplify how filters, pooling, and flattening work in CNNs.Once I had a good grasp of the concepts, I decided to implement a basic CNN model using TensorFlow. For the dataset, i selected the CIFAR-10 dataset, which is a popular image dataset containing 10 classes including cats and dogs. but from the 10 catogries i took only 2 and differetiate between cat and dog, I filtered the dataset to keep only the cat and dog images. After that, i normalized the image pixel values to make the model training more efficient and converted the labels into binary values (0 for cat, 1 for dog).i constructed the CNN model by stacking convolutional and pooling layers, followed by dense layers for classification. Using TensorFlow’s high-level Keras API made it easier to define the model architecture and compile it with the appropriate loss function and optimizer. I trained the model using the filtered CIFAR-10 data and evaluated its performance using test accuracy and loss.To test the model , I also wrote code that would allow me to input a new image and let the model predict whether the image is of a cat or a dog. I left a placeholder in the code where the image path can be inserted later for another picture to be tested.This task helped me understand how CNN are used for image classification and how models can learn to identify complex patterns in pictures. Through this project, I also understood how deep learning can be applied in practical areas like: Animal Detection – identifying pets from security footage, Healthcare – detecting diseases from medical images, Self-Driving Cars – recognizing objects like traffic signs and pedestrians, E-commerce – classifying product photos, and Face Recognition – verifying identity through facial features.##
